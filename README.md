# Data Analysis and Visualization with NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

This project demonstrates how to use popular Python libraries—NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn—to perform data analysis and create insightful visualizations.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure that you have the following Python libraries installed:

- **NumPy**: A library for numerical operations and working with arrays.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation library for working with structured data.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: A data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

You can install these libraries via `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
